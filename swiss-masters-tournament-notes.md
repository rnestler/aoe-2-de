# Swiss Masters Tournament Notes

# Game 1

## Arabia

### Dark Age
 * Wrong scouting -> Didn't find sheep
 * Should add farms if sheeps not found
 * Farms are more efficient then berries

### Feudal
 * Should scout enemy earlier
 * Should build blacksmith later
 * Scout rush earlier if enemy is up so late
 * Only add devensive upgrade to scouts if I go heavy scouts
 * Bad microing against spears
 * Bad walling
 * Refresh lumber camp earlier
 * Very bad walling (panic walls :D)
   * Hole in the wall
   * Overchopping
   * Wrong repair walling
 * Wheelbarrow maybe earlier

### Castle / Imp
 * Defense: Fucked up gathering the army and attacking with all of them once
   enemy was in
 * Completly forgot about reliqs
 * Siege vs. Knights??? Better monastry
 * Forgot about Imp
 * Use the Army!!!
 * Forgot stone -> No castle
 * Forgot sooo many upgrades!!!
 * No forward castle when Imp is incomming
 * Forgot defense castle
 * Lot of military idle
 * No second castle
 * Misclick and only produced in one barack xD
 * Eco completly down in end game
 * Did not see gold close to me



## 4 Lakes

### Dark Age

 * Focus more on deep fish -> huge food source, the best one
 * Better Boar management -> almost lost a vil
 * Early Dock
 * Steal boar next time ;)

### Feudal
 * More Aggressive attack.... No damage in wood line...
 * Possible damage would have been huge with Scouts
 * Defensive castle!!
 * Build stuff when you have ressources


## Last Game

 * No Blacksmith before Archer Range
 * Use my advantage
 * Use my resources
 * Do upgrades faster!


# Game 2

## Arabia

 * How to defend against a drush for noobs:
   * Don't panic
   * Do not build barracks out of reach from TC
   * Do not build a tower that is completely useless
   * Use 6 vils to build, which would win the fight

## Four Lakes

 * More vils on wood
 * Build second LC faster
 * Finish your opponent if they are down
 * Vil snipe with archers was nice, but then attack!
